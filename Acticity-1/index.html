    <h1><em>Scrambled Eggs</em></h1>
    <p>Eggs are on of my favorite foods. Here is a recipe for deliciously rich scrambled eggs.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 tbs butter</li>
        <li>2 tbs cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt butter in a frying pan over a medium heat.</li>
        <li>Gently mix the eggs and cream in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Once butter has melted add cream and eggs.</li>
        <li>Using a spatula fold the eggs from the edge of the pan to the center every 20 seconds.</li>
        <li>When the eggs are still moist remove from the heat (it will continue to cook on the plate until served).</li>
        As I said <blockquote>Scrambled Eggs are my favorite breakfast.</blockquote>
    </ol>
